# Scavenge
The purpose of the game is to make your Kani as strong as possible. To do this
you can buy [buffs](/glossary/#buff) from KappaBot. To buy the buffs you need
[scum](/glossary/#scum). Therefore, your objective is to collect as much scum
as possible to make your Kani as strong as possible. 

One of the primary methods for acquiring scum is by running the
[`?scavenge`](/docs/commands/#scavenge) command in the
[#mangroves-scavenge-here](/docs/channels/mangroves-scavenge-here) channel.
There is a 10 hour cool down for this command. When you run this command your
rumbler Kani will collect between 25 and 60 scum. Rewards vary based on a d100
roll. Players have a 75% chance to get a reward between 25-35 scum, 15% chance
to get between 35-50, and a 10% chance to get 55-60. There is also a 5% chance
to scavenge a [blockchain fragment](/glossary#blockchain-fragment).
