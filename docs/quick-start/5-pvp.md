# Challenge a Player
You can use the [`?pvp`](/docs/commands/#pvp) command to challenge another
player's rumbler kani. Like the [`?scavenge`](/docs/commands/#scavenge) and
[`?pve`](/docs/commands/#pve) commands from the previous steps, this command is
on a 10 hour cooldown. It will cost you 10 scum to mount the attack, so make
sure you choose a player that you have a reasonable chance of beating. You can
use the [`?whobuff`](/docs/commands/#whobuff) and [`?lb`](/docs/commands/#lb)
commands to see which players have a similar or weaker rumbler and are sitting
on a nice big pile of scum.

See [Player vs. Player](/docs/gameplay/pvp) for more details.
